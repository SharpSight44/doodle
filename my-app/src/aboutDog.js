    The Goolden Doodle 
</h1>
<p>
The Goldendoodle is a cross between a Golden Retriever and a Poodle. At their best, they are intelligent, friendly, and super affectionate. They come in three sizes: miniature (weighing 15 to 30 pounds), medium (30 to 45 pounds), and standard (45 to more than 100 pounds).

Goldendoodles have a moderate activity level. Larger Goldendoodles may be more active than their smaller kin. They need a good walk or active playtime each day, and if youâ€™re interested, they are athletic enough to participate in such dog sports as agility, flyball, obedience, and rally. They can also be excellent therapy dogs.

Both of the breeds used to create Goldendoodles tend to be smart and learn quickly. If you begin socialization and training early and use positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards, you will be met with a wonderful companion.

Poodles have a reputation for being hypoallergenic, meaning that they can be tolerated by people who have allergies to dogs. Because they have the poodle in their heritage, Goldendoodles are sometimes promoted as being low to non shedding hypoallergenic dogs.
